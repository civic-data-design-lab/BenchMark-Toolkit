One of the most challenging problems facing urban designers and planners today is the difficulty of developing robust and effective methods of studying public spaces that result in more informed decision making. At its core, this problem revolves around measuring *Public Life*, a term often referenced in Jan Gehl’s work that refers to citizens’ daily interactions with others within the built environment.

The Benchmark project investigates how we can use technology to better measure and analyze the qualitative elements of public life. More specifically, by tracing human interaction in space, we can begin to understand quantitatively what makes a “good” urban space and then develop metrics that can be used to improve the public realm. Benchmark begins to address this question by introducing mobile urban furniture embedded with sensors that simultaneously create flexible public spaces and collect information about how these spaces operate socially.
